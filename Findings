Manual Review: 

1.ðŸŸ   No minimumPositionSize for opening a position, so if not provided other functions get affected for unnecceasrily lower balance fees count


2. ðŸ”´ In increasePositionSize function, the borrowing fees has applied on a original position
.it should be applied on a new position, after the positionFee is being applied. Also, it should be applied after checking the healthFactor.
this may lead to the leverage ratio being higher than intended (this may result in liquidation) (HIGH, I hope so)


3. ðŸ”´ In liquidate function: No insufficient collateral-condition-check before reducing borrowing fees from collateral
   (i.e. what if position.collaateral < borrwingfees). also after calculating pnl 


4. ðŸ”´ In liquidate function: No insufficient collateral-condition-check before reducing liquidation fees from collateral
   (i.e. what if position.collateral < liquidationfees). Liquidators will not be incentivized to liquidate those accounts that do not 
   provide them with a liquidation fee. As a result, the liquidation of these accounts might be delayed or not performed at all.


5. ðŸ”´ No position health check in increasePositionSize function beofre applying borrowing and position fees, 
leading a miscalculation which eventually affects the liquidation conditions. 


6. ðŸŸ¢ BorrowingFee applied in function increaseCollateral. No need. 


7. ðŸŸ  In decreasePosition function, borrowingFee has been deducted without considering the PnL || positionHealth of the given state of UserPosition.
    +  fees deduction applied on the original price insstead of new one. 
 so if a legitimate user close to liquidation, who may want to reduce leverage by decreasing position will end up immediately liquidatable, due to 
 fees getting cut from collateral even before checking pnl. 


8.  ðŸ”´  In function isLiquidatable, positionCollateral value can be <= 0, No non-zero && non-negative checks are provided 
    before calculating leverage. Hence leaving many positions unliquidatable.(Critical???)


9.   ðŸŸ In function increasePositionCollateral, positionHealth check is not done before adding the collateral ammount. 


10. ðŸ”´  no withdrawCollateral function 

11. ðŸ”´ no closePosition funct

ðŸŸ¢ no deposit collateral 


(optional) 
* No getter functions for private/internal variables
